# gRPC Server Example

This example shows how to implement a **gRPC API with TypeScript** and [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client). It is based on a SQLite database, you can find the database file with some dummy data at [`./prisma/dev.db`](./prisma/dev.db).

## Getting started

### 1. Download example and install dependencies

Download this example:

```
npx try-prisma@latest --template orm/grpc
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd grpc
npm install
```

<details><summary><strong>Alternative:</strong> Clone the entire repo</summary>

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git --depth=1
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd prisma-examples/orm/grpc
npm install
```

</details>

#### [Optional] Switch database to Prisma Postgres

This example uses a local SQLite database by default. If you want to use to [Prisma Postgres](https://prisma.io/postgres), follow these instructions (otherwise, skip to the next step):

1. Set up a new Prisma Postgres instance in the Prisma Data Platform [Console](https://console.prisma.io) and copy the database connection URL.
2. Update the `datasource` block to use `postgresql` as the `provider` and paste the database connection URL as the value for `url`:
    ```prisma
    datasource db {
      provider = "postgresql"
      url      = "prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=ey...."
    }
    ```

    > **Note**: In production environments, we recommend that you set your connection URL via an [environment variable](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/development-environment/environment-variables/managing-env-files-and-setting-variables), e.g. using a `.env` file.
3. Install the Prisma Accelerate extension:
    ```
    npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate
    ```
4. Add the Accelerate extension to the `PrismaClient` instance:
    ```diff
    + import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate"

    + const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())
    ```

That's it, your project is now configured to use Prisma Postgres!

### 2. Create and seed the database

Run the following command to create your database. This also creates the `User` and `Post` tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

When `npx prisma migrate dev` is executed against a newly created database, seeding is also triggered. The seed file in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) will be executed and your database will be populated with the sample data.

**If you switched to Prisma Postgres in the previous step**, you need to trigger seeding manually (because Prisma Postgres already created an empty database instance for you, so seeding isn't triggered):

```
npx prisma db seed
```


### 3. Start the gRPC server

Execute this command to start the gRPC server:

```
npm run dev
```

The server is now running on `0.0.0.0:50051`.

### 4. Using the gRPC API

To use the gRPC API, you need a gRPC client. We provide several client scripts inside the [`./client`](./client) directory. Each script is named according to the operation it performs against the gRPC API (e.g. the [`feed.js`](./client/feed.js) script sends the [`Feed`](./service.proto#L7) operation). Each script can be invoked by running the corresponding NPM script defined in [`package.json`](./package.json), e.g. `npm run feed`.

In case you prefer a GUI client, we recommend [BloomRPC](https://github.com/uw-labs/bloomrpc):

## Evolving the app

Evolving the application typically requires two steps:

1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate
1. Update your application code

For the following example scenario, assume you want to add a "profile" feature to the app where users can create a profile and write a short bio about themselves.

### 1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate

The first step is to add a new table, e.g. called `Profile`, to the database. You can do this by adding a new model to your [Prisma schema file](./prisma/schema.prisma) file and then running a migration afterwards:

```diff
// schema.prisma

model Post {
  id        Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  author    User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
}

model User {
  id      Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id 
  name    String? 
  email   String   @unique
  posts   Post[]
+ profile Profile?
}

+model Profile {
+  id     Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
+  bio    String?
+  userId Int     @unique
+  user   User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
+}
```

Once you've updated your data model, you can execute the changes against your database with the following command:

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 2. Update your application code

You can now use your `PrismaClient` instance to perform operations against the new `Profile` table. Here are some examples:

#### Create a new profile for an existing user

```ts
const profile = await prisma.profile.create({
  data: {
    bio: "Hello World",
    user: {
      connect: { email: "alice@prisma.io" },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Create a new user with a new profile

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: "john@prisma.io",
    name: "John",
    profile: {
      create: {
        bio: "Hello World",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Update the profile of an existing user

```ts
const userWithUpdatedProfile = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: "alice@prisma.io" },
  data: {
    profile: {
      update: {
        bio: "Hello Friends",
      },
    },
  },
});
```


## Switch to another database (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB)

If you want to try this example with another database than SQLite, you can adjust the the database connection in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) by reconfiguring the `datasource` block. 

Learn more about the different connection configurations in the [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/connection-urls).

<details><summary>Expand for an overview of example configurations with different databases</summary>

### PostgreSQL

For PostgreSQL, the connection URL has the following structure:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=SCHEMA"
}
```

Here is an example connection string with a local PostgreSQL database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/notesapi?schema=public"
}
```

### MySQL

For MySQL, the connection URL has the following structure:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = "mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
}
```

Here is an example connection string with a local MySQL database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = "mysql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:3306/notesapi"
}
```

### Microsoft SQL Server

Here is an example connection string with a local Microsoft SQL Server database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlserver"
  url      = "sqlserver://localhost:1433;initial catalog=sample;user=sa;password=mypassword;"
}
```

### MongoDB

Here is an example connection string with a local MongoDB database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = "mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority"
}
```
